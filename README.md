# Top Courses - React Project

Welcome to Top Courses, my first React project! This project showcases a variety of courses from different fields including Development, Business, Design, and Lifestyle. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can easily filter courses based on their interests and preferences.

## Features

- **Filtering Courses**: Users can filter courses by different categories including Development, Business, Design, and Lifestyle. By default, all courses are displayed, but users can easily select a specific category by clicking on the corresponding filter tab.

- **Like and Dislike Courses**: Users have the option to like or dislike courses according to their preferences. A toast notification will appear confirming the action.
